## Project Description
This project aims to build a comprehensive hyperlocal delivery platform tailored for customers located within a 3-mile radius of local shops and food vendors. The platform allows users to browse nearby grocery stores, restaurants, and small-scale food points, view item details including prices and availability, add items to a cart, and place orders for home delivery. Customers receive live updates on their order statusâ€”from confirmation to preparation and deliveryâ€”and can track the delivery agentâ€™s location in real-time.

To ensure quality and trust, customers are encouraged to leave feedback and ratings for each vendor, product, and delivery experience. This helps other users make informed decisions and motivates vendors and delivery personnel to maintain high service standards.

Vendors have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage their inventory, update product availability, set business hours, and view incoming orders. Delivery personnel use a mobile interface to accept delivery requests, navigate to destinations, and update the order status at each step.

The platform emphasizes ease of use, responsiveness, and seamless interactions among all user types. Key non-functional goals include maintaining a fast user interface, ensuring high system availability, and providing secure transactions and data privacy. The user experience is designed to be intuitive and efficient, even for individuals with limited digital literacy.

Overall, this system supports the growing demand for convenient, reliable, and locally focused delivery services, fostering stronger connections between neighborhood vendors and their surrounding communities.
