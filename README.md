# ðŸ“¦ Hyperlocal Delivery & Food Ordering System

## Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive hyperlocal delivery and food ordering platform tailored for customers located within a 3-mile radius of local shops and food vendors. The platform allows users to browse nearby grocery stores, restaurants, and small-scale food points, view item details including prices and availability, add items to a cart, and place orders for home delivery. 

Customers receive live updates on their order statusâ€”from confirmation to preparation and deliveryâ€”and can track the delivery agentâ€™s location in real time.
